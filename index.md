> # Welcome
> I'm a Master's student here in Nara, attempting to navigate the fascinating, complex landscapes where circuits hum, code compiles, and machine learning models... occasionally get stuck in interesting local minima. Consider this a logbook of that optimization journey â€“ fueled by curiosity (and perhaps a bit too much caffeine). Glad to have you aboard.

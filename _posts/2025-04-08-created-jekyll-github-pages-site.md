I've recently launched my new personal website, built using **Jekyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

## Why Jekyll & GitHub Pages?

*   **Simplicity:** Write content in Markdown, Jekyll builds the static site.
*   **Integration:** Native support on GitHub Pages makes deployment easy (just push!).
*   **Free:** Hosting is free for public repositories.
*   **Customizable:** Themes and plugins allow for flexibility.

<!-- ## What's Next?

I plan to share updates on:

*   Research activities
*   Technical topics I'm learning
*   Personal projects
*   Other thoughts -->

Thanks for visiting!
